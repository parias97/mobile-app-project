Elevator pitch:

There are many apps out there that keep track of inventory and profit tracking but not many of them are aimed towards individuals who enjoy reselling as a side gig. We are creating an app that keeps resellers organized and aware of the profits they’ve made from previous sales on e-commerce platforms or elsewhere. Resellers will be able to snap pictures of their purchased items, write a description of the item along with the initial price they paid, and start keeping track of their inventory. Once an item sells, they can log the selling price and we’ll calculate their profits subtracting any fees that come from specific e-commerce platforms like eBay or Mercari.
