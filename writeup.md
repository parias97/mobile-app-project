Report:

There are many apps out there that keep track of inventory and profit tracking but not many of them are aimed towards individuals who enjoy reselling as a side gig. We are creating an app that keeps resellers organized and aware of the profits theyâ€™ve made from previous sales on e-commerce platforms or elsewhere. Resellers will be able to snap pictures of their purchased items, write a description of the item along with the initial price they paid, and start keeping track of their inventory. 

How To Use:  

Self-Explanatory

Launch Instructions: 

This app can either be run using the .apk executable that can be found in the project repository or you can pull the source code files from GitHub to manually build and run them in Android Studio.
